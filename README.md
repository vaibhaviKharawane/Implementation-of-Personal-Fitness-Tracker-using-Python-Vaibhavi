The system architecture diagram represents a machine learning-based calorie prediction model using a Random Forest Regressor. Here's a brief explanation of each component:
Load Calories Data & Load Exercise Data – The system imports historical calorie and exercise data.
Feature Engineering – Extracts relevant features from the data to improve model performance.
User Input Features – Users provide real-time input (e.g., weight, activity type, duration).
Random Forest Regressor – A machine learning model used for calorie prediction.
Train the Model – The model is trained on the processed data.
Evaluation – The model is tested for accuracy and optimized.
Deployment – The final model is deployed for real-world use.
